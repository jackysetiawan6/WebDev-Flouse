            At Flouse, we want your plants to thrive! Here are some general care tips to keep your new botanical companions flourishing:
            </div>

            <div class="sub1">
                <div class="sub3">Light:</div>
                <div class="sub2">
                    <ul class="point">
                        <li>Bright Indirect Light: Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect light. This means they enjoy a well-lit space but not direct sunlight for extended periods. South-facing windows can be too harsh, while north-facing windows might not provide enough light. East or west-facing windows with sheer curtains are often ideal.</li>
                        <li>Observe Your Plant: Pay attention to how your plant responds to its current location. Leaning towards the light source indicates a need for more light. Conversely, yellowing leaves suggest too much direct sun.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub1">
                <div class="sub3">Watering:</div>
                <div class="sub2">
                    <ul class="point">
                        <li>The Finger Test:  This is a simple way to avoid overwatering, a common mistake. Stick your finger into the soil about an inch deep. If it feels dry, it's time to water. If it feels moist, wait a few days and check again.</li>
                        <li>Watering Frequency:  The frequency of watering depends on the plant variety, pot size, and season. Generally, water deeply when the top inch of soil dries out, allowing excess water to drain from the pot's drainage holes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub1">
                <div class="sub3">Humidity:</div>
                <div class="sub2">
                    <ul class="point">
                        <li>Boost Humidity (Optional): Some plants appreciate extra humidity, especially during dry months. Group plants together to create a mini humid microclimate. Alternatively, use a pebble tray filled with water or a humidifier near your plants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub1">
                <div class="sub3">Temperature:</div>
                <div class="sub2">
                    <ul class="point">
                        <li>Average Room Temperature: Most houseplants thrive in average room temperatures between 65째F and 75째F (18째C and 24째C). Avoid placing them near drafts or vents with extreme temperature fluctuations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub1">
                <div class="sub3">Fertilizing:</div>
                <div class="sub2">
                    <ul class="point">
                        <li>Moderate Feeding: During the growing season (spring and summer), you can lightly fertilize your plants once a month with a balanced fertilizer diluted according to package instructions. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can damage roots.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="sub1">
                <div class="sub3">Repotting:</div>
                <div class="sub2">
                    <ul class="point">
                        <li>Growth Spurt: As your plant matures, it may become rootbound in its current pot. Signs include slow growth, roots circling the pot's drainage holes, or the plant easily tipping over. Repot into a slightly larger pot with fresh potting mix when necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <div class="apa3"><b>Bonus Tip!</b> Regularly rotate your plant to ensure even growth on all sides.</div>
            <div class="apa3"><b>Remember:</b> These are general guidelines. For specific care needs,  research your plant variety to ensure it thrives in your home environment.  Flouse also offers additional plant care information on many of our product pages. Happy planting!</div>
